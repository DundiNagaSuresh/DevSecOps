In this Course I would like to use GitLab as my CI/CD Tool.Easy to use, Don't need to Deploy anywhere to Configure Pipelines. 
Pipeline Code sits in Source Code Repositary, Don't require any Webhook Integrations to Trigger CI/CD Pipeline. Configure Pipeline to Run, on Required Events[ Push to Specific Repo, Pull]

Main Part of CI/CD lies on understanding the Flow of Building Application Code, Stages in which Code will be transformed into an Deployable Artifact, Docker Images to Create Containers and Pods in case of Kubernetes.

Flow of Pipeline - Tools used in Different Stages - all corelate each other to build application in secure format meeting compliance standards of organizations.
 
For Understanding CI/CD Better, I would recommend watching 
1. GitLab in 1 hour Session by CloudChamp
2. Crash Course of GitLab by TechWorld with Nana

By Following along this Course I would like to build Complex CI/CD Pipelines on GitLab including Different Stages.
We will learn different tools like Maven, Gardle, Sonarqube, Nexus, OWASP, Docker, trivy, AgroCD, Helm Charts etc...

Will Build Mutliple Projects on Different Languages and Get Maximum Exposure. 

Building a Full Scale Corporate Project for Highlighting in Resume for Better Career Opportunites.
